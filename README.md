# UniFiles YouTube

[![Build and release](https://github.com/monokaijs/unifiles-youtube-music/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/monokaijs/unifiles-youtube-music/actions/workflows/build.yml)

YouTube Music catalog and audio resolution for **UniFiles plugin API v1**.
The provider runs in the app's QuickJS interpreter and uses native HTTP through
`host.http.json`. It has no JavaScript runtime dependencies.

This repository publishes the YouTube source extracted from UniFiles. It follows
the build layout of [minip-ytb-music-source](https://github.com/monokaijs/minip-ytb-music-source):
ESM, CommonJS, a minified IIFE, and TypeScript declarations under `dist/`. The
exports implement the current UniFiles API; they are not a drop-in MiniP API adapter.

## Download

Use a [tagged release](https://github.com/monokaijs/unifiles-youtube-music/releases) for a
fixed version, or the committed `dist/` files on `main` for the current build.

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`dist/manifest.json`](dist/manifest.json) | Installation manifest with a pinned JS entry URL and SHA-256 checksum |
| [`dist/youtube.js`](dist/youtube.js) | Canonical ES module, identical to `src/index.js`; use with the native host |
| [`dist/youtube.json`](dist/youtube.json) | Strict UniFiles API v1 manifest; identical to `plugin.json` |
| [`dist/index.esm.js`](dist/index.esm.js) | Bundled ESM build |
| [`dist/index.cjs`](dist/index.cjs) | CommonJS build, preserving the original distribution filename |
| [`dist/index.iife.min.js`](dist/index.iife.min.js) | Minified bundle exposing `globalThis.UniFilesYouTube` |
| [`dist/index.d.ts`](dist/index.d.ts) | Provider and host TypeScript interfaces |
| [`dist/SHA256SUMS`](dist/SHA256SUMS) | SHA-256 checksums for all seven files above |

The original-style raw CommonJS URL is:

```

Checksums verify file integrity; they are not publisher signatures.

UniFiles loads this provider only after explicit installation. Open
**Media → Media sources → + → Install plugin** and paste this manifest URL:

```text
https://github.com/monokaijs/unifiles-youtube-music/releases/latest/download/manifest.json
```

The root `manifest.json` and `dist/manifest.json` are generated installation
manifests. They include the provider identity, API version, permissions, an
absolute `entry` URL pinned to this release, and the entry file’s hex `sha256`.
Any HTTPS host can serve this format; GitHub is only the hosting location here.
The app checks the source checksum and saves the package locally. Updates use
the saved manifest URL. A fresh app has no YouTube source; Remove unregisters it.

`plugin.json` contains the strict runtime metadata used to generate both the
installation manifest and the legacy `youtube.json` runtime manifest.

## API

```js
const page = await browse({
  sourceInstanceId: 'youtube-music',
  query: 'Beethoven',
  parent: null,
  cursor: null
});

const playback = await resolve({
  sourceInstanceId: 'youtube-music',
  itemId: page.items.find(item => item.playable).reference.itemId
});
```

- `browse` returns `{items, nextCursor, sections}` for search, home shelves, collections,
  related songs, and continuation pages. Explore sections preserve YouTube’s shelf
  titles and ordered `itemIds` referencing the same page’s items; search stays flat.
- `resolve` returns `{url, mimeType, durationMs, canDownload}`. The native host
  validates the URL and creates the playback session. Resolve fresh URLs for each
  playback; signed media URLs should not be persisted.
- `parsePage` and `parsePlayback` are also exported for fixture-based tests.

The host must provide `globalThis.host.http.json({url, method, headers, body})`,
returning a promise for parsed JSON. The native host enforces HTTPS, domain grants,
response size limits, cancellation, and interpreter resource limits. Media bytes,
downloads and playback remain native. This plugin needs only the `http` capability;
it does not require access to files, credentials, cookies, or native crypto.

The manifest allows requests to `music.youtube.com` and `www.youtube.com`, and
playback on `*.googlevideo.com`. InnerTube is an unofficial API; availability can
change. Sign-in requirements and unsupported/cipher-only streams are returned as
errors. The source does not bypass content or network restrictions.

## Development

Use Node.js 24 or newer and Rust 1.88 or newer for the compatibility test.

```sh
npm ci
npm run check
```

`npm run build` produces deterministic bundles and checksums. `npm test` tests all
four JavaScript formats against catalog/player fixtures. `npm run test:types`
checks the published declarations. `npm run test:quickjs` executes both ES module
artifacts using `rquickjs 0.14.0`, matching the UniFiles host's interpreter binding.
These are deterministic offline tests; they do not claim to test YouTube's current
network behavior or duplicate the app's native HTTP implementation.

Edit `src/index.js`, `src/index.d.ts`, or `plugin.json`, run the checks, and commit
the regenerated `dist/` files. The canonical module remains directly usable by the
app without a Node.js bundler at app build time.

## CI and releases

Pushes to `main`, pull requests, and manual runs build and test the source, check
that committed `dist/` matches a fresh build, and upload a downloadable Actions
artifact. CI uses Node.js 24 and Rust 1.88.0 with locked dependencies.

To release, update the version in both `package.json` and `plugin.json`, refresh
the npm lockfile, rebuild and commit, then push a matching `vX.Y.Z` tag. The release
job runs only after the checks pass and uploads every `dist/` file to GitHub Releases.
The build rejects tags that do not match the package/manifest version. Release tags
should be immutable; use a new version for corrections.

```sh
npm version 2.0.1 --no-git-tag-version
# Update plugin.json to the same version.
npm run check
git add package.json package-lock.json plugin.json manifest.json dist
git commit -m "chore(release): prepare v2.0.1"
git tag -a v2.0.1 -m "YouTube source v2.0.1"
git push origin main v2.0.1
```

## Source split in v2

This is the **YouTube Music** provider (`youtube-music`), renamed from `unifiles-youtube`. Install its new manifest URL to add it as a separate source. The [regular YouTube provider](https://github.com/monokaijs/unifiles-youtube) has ID `youtube`. Both can be installed together; neither ships built into UniFiles. Older `youtube` references remain valid video IDs in the regular provider. Legacy release assets are retained at their original URLs.
